Overview

These projects focusing on the implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for a classification problem and a k-means clustering algorithm for data grouping. The projects are implemented as part of the coursework.

Projects
Project 1: Neural Networks and MLP Implementation

The first project explores the development of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with three hidden layers for a classification task. We investigated various configurations, activation functions (Logistic, Tanh, ReLU), and batch sizes to evaluate the generalization capability of the MLP model.

Key Features

•	Implementation of logistic sigmoid activation function for output layers.

•	Gradient descent algorithm with mini-batch support for network training.

•	Analysis of network performance across different configurations.

Project 2: k-Means Clustering Algorithm

The second project involves the implementation of a k-means clustering algorithm to group a set of randomly generated data points. The program allows for the dynamic setting of the number of clusters and iterations, providing insights into the optimal grouping and error minimization.

Key Features

•	Generation of random data sets following specific criteria.

•	Dynamic setting of the cluster count through code modification.

•	Execution of multiple algorithm runs to find the minimum grouping error.

Prerequisites

•	Java Development Kit (JDK) or C compiler (GCC), depending on the project's programming language.

•	No external libraries are required for the execution of these projects.

Running the Projects
